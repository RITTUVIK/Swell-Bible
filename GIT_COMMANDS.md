# Git Commands to Push Your Code

After all files are recreated, run these commands:

```bash
cd "D:\Swell Bible\swell-bible"

# Stage all files
git add .

# Commit with message
git commit -m "Complete React Native app with TypeScript - 4 screens with purple/gold theme"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

**Note:** Windows treats `swell-bible` and `Swell-Bible` as the SAME folder (case-insensitive).
That's why the copy command failed. All files are now being recreated directly in `swell-bible`.
